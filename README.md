# Key-Value Store in C

A high-performance, in-memory key-value store implemented in C with file persistence capabilities. This project demonstrates fundamental systems programming concepts including hash tables, memory management, file I/O, and error handling.

## Features

- **Fast Operations**: O(1) average-case lookup, insertion, and deletion using hash tables
- **Dynamic Resizing**: Automatically grows to maintain performance as data scales
- **File Persistence**: Save and load data to/from binary files
- **Memory Safe**: Proper memory management with no leaks (Valgrind clean)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and recovery
- **Interactive CLI**: User-friendly command-line interface
- **Comprehensive Tests**: Full test suite with edge case coverage
